## What is this?


## What do I do?

1. First, clone the respository and change into the directory:
  *`git clone https://github.com/loraxx753/design-doc-concept.git && cd design-doc-concept`
2. Install the dependencies used for transpiling and working on evergreen browsers :
  *`npm i `
  *_NOTE_: These dependencies are only used in package.json. With a few minutes of effort (and no transpiling or evergreening), this step is optional.
3. Run `npm start` and visit [127.0.0.1:8080/](127.0.0.1:8080/)
